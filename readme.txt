This project is a part of PortfolioLab for CodersLab.

The name of this project is "Charity". The idea behind is to make a website, which allows registration,
login and donation of different kinds of gifts to charity. There are several institutions to choose from, and gifts
are categorized.

This project uses Spring Boot with Hibernate, Data JPA, Spring Form and Maven
and will eventually include Spring Security.
